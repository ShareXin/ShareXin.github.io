        <p>I've been developing ShareXin for over a year now, and I enjoy it. I enjoy finding solutions to problems for new features, debugging, and packaging, so that y'all can enjoy my work.</p>
        <p>ShareXin does have problems that don't make it a 1:1 clone of ShareX (namely, no custom uploader support, clunky CLI, relying on external tools for most of its job (screenshotting, sending to Twitter/Mastodon)), but I hope to eventually fix those problems to truly be worth the name "ShareX for Linux and FreeBSD"</p>
        <p>If you like the work I've done, and want to support me and my endeavours, please consider donating to my Patreon. I'm currently going through University and developing ShareXin cuts into alot of my free time. ShareXin will always be free and open-source, and I don't get paid for it.</p>
