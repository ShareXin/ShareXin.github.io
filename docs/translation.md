## What you need to know

* Fluency in English
* Good understanding of ShareXin so that during translation you know exactly what you are translating
* How to use GitHub so you can pull/push translations
* Good patience - because translation can take long time and can be boring
* Please refrain from using machine translation e.g. Google Translate

## How to start translating?

I am using a custom YAML-based translation system. You can base your translation on this [en.yml](https://github.com/ShareXin/ShareXin/blob/a206ccf135065a7c22868d9191e093c3ab83705b/lang/en.yml) file.

Anything after ":" on each line is the sentence you may edit.
Please do not edit any of the words before the ":".

The file name for your translation will be based on the [ISO-639-1/ISO-639-2](https://datahub.io/core/language-codes) standard.
If you believe your specific dialect/language is different enough from other dialects/languages in your country listed under [UTF-8 locales](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Table_of_locales), then in your pull request, please explain why the difference is significant enough.
